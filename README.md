# CTL-Monthly-Tickets-Report-WebView
## Project description
- I have started developing the website to use HTML and CSS to create great web views of reports with little tables and charts. 
- The application uses Tomcat local server to run while in the developing process.
- It uses the Java Servlet and JSP technologies to handle requests, communicate with the database, and return HTML pages to the client browser.
- The project is linked with another project in this repos https://github.com/tnguyen7s/CSTL-Tickets-Data-Webscraper
- My attempt is to make the website complete by providing different views to visualize different types of reports. Then, I would like to host it in a cloud server so that someone would like to take a look at it or use it can have access to it remotely through the Internet.
