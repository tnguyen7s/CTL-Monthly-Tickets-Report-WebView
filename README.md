# CTL-Monthly-Tickets-Report-WebView
## Project description
- I have started developing the website using HTML and CSS to create great web views of reports with little tables and charts. 
- The application runs on a Tomcat local server while in the developing process.
- It uses the Java Servlet and JSP technologies to handle requests, communicate with the database, and return HTML pages to the client browser.
- The project is linked with another project in this repos https://github.com/tnguyen7s/CSTL-Tickets-Data-Webscraper
- I attempt to make the website complete by providing different views to visualize different types of reports. Then, I would like to host it on a cloud server so that someone who would like to take a look at it or use it can have access to it remotely through the Internet.
